# Materialize Hack Day

Welcome to the first in-person Materialize hack day! We're really excited to have you all join us at Materialize HQ. The goal of the event is to have folks try out Materialize for the first time, and to get participants comfortable on the platform in just a few short hours. In order to do that, we will introduce some key concepts, provide some sample code, and set you off to complete some SQL challenges on your own. (We'll be there to support you as you venture out!)

## What to expect

If you're familiar with Materialize, great! If you aren't, also great! We're going to start from the beginning with our hack day, so no prior knowledge of Materialize is expected or required. All you _will_ need during the hack day is your own laptop, we'll provide everything else.

The hack day will be split into three parts, all led by Frank McSherry:

1. **[Introducing Materialize](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/mz-hack-day-july-2023/blob/main/worked_examples/introductory.md)**: a walkthrough of introductory concepts that begin to illustrate the power of Materialize.
2. **[Advanced Concepts](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/mz-hack-day-july-2023/blob/main/worked_examples/advanced.md)**: once you've got the basics down, we'll get you using the features that make Materialize uniquely powerful.
3. **[Electives](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/mz-hack-day-july-2023/blob/main/worked_examples/electives.md)**: now that you're a Materialize expert, dig deeper into advanced SQL, learn how Materialize would fit into your usual workflows, or try building on new sets of data.

Frank will introduce and explain each section of examples, and the Materialize team will be on hand as you work through them yourself. We're here to learn what you love, fix what you don't, and help you be successful trying out Materialize.
